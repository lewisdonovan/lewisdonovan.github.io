Iâ€™m a web developer based in London, UK, creating awesome stuff in the digital space. I have 11 years' professional experience as a full-stack web developer, and a total 17 years' of professional experience across various industries, including tech, music, events and media. In that time, I've been fortunate enough for my work to have been nominated for two Webby Awards, and a Clio Award, winning one of each.

I was formerly the Lead Web Developer at [Sony Music UK](https://sonymusic.co.uk), and am currently CTO and Co-founder of [SonX](https://sonx.com/), as well as providing consulting and development services on a freelance basis via my business [Yeah Yeah London](https://yeahyeah.london).

### Philosophy
My approach to technology is firmly rooted in the needs of the end-user. I believe that any solution should be so intuitive and seamless that it feels like a natural extension of the user.

For this reason, I traverse multiple languages, stacks and frameworks, on both the front and back-end, opting for what is best suited to a given problem, as opposed to what is most expedient. I pride myself on the ability to identify and understand a problem, and having the knowledge and resources to deliver a pragmatic and holistic solution.

>Only when technology is invisible, is it of any use.
